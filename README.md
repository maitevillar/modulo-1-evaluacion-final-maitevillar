## Git

Definition from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git):

> *Git (/ɡɪt/) is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source-code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision-control system, it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.*
